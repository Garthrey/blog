## walks - jan 7th, 2026
I don't go on many now,
they're too solitary 
and thoughts move faster 
the slower I go,
instead of stumbling down 
steep hills at a horizontal angle
one foot always catching up
to the other's brace,
I like to ride my bike
feet in unison.

I can't think on a bike
atleast not over that desire
to go faster
and grip those handlebars
like I'm a punk kid
speeding down in an uncle's car,
she tells me everything I need to know
and I spill my heart to her
knowing my words get scattered
to the wind like little letters
with unstamped envelopes
sent to every bushy tree I pass
and every bird I swerve around
on the great road,
my bike doesn't need to understand me
just like a dog doesn't,
we just need to know when we're going
and she kisses my feet and asks
'how fast'
and I finally feel like a child
