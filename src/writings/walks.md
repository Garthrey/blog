![bike on a pier](/_includes/img/bikepier.jpg)
I don't go on many now,\
they're too solitary\
and thoughts move faster\
the slower I go,\
instead of stumbling down\
steep hills at a horizontal angle\
one foot always catching up\
to the other's brace,\
I like to ride my bike\
feet in unison.

I can't think on a bike\
atleast not over that desire\
to go faster\
and grip those handlebars\
like I'm a punk kid\
speeding down in an uncle's car,\
she tells me everything I need to know\
and I spill my heart to her\
knowing my words get scattered\
to the wind like little letters\
with unstamped envelopes\
sent to every bushy tree I pass\
and every bird I swerve around\
on the great road,\
my bike doesn't need to understand me\
just like a dog doesn't,\
we just need to know when we're going\
and she kisses my feet and asks\
'how fast'\
and I finally feel like a child

# author's note
falling in love with my first bike, riding it every day since i got it. this bike helped me through a lot of feelings, and heavily inspired by kino's journey, it truly does feel like a companion to me more than a vehicle or tool. i find myself personifying it too much oftentimes- like when the crank would make a funny noise i'd apologise, or if i push the bike too hard or scrape it i'll ask if she's okay. 

this poem also comes at a time where i'm rediscovering a sense of childhood in myself from growing up too fast (see the blog: 'growing into a child') and the bike has become something i feel deeply connected to and serves as an internal metaphor for a newfound sense of freedom, both in the way that i can get to places more readily but also have an emotional freedom to be a stupid kid once again.
