not a romantic yearning- no.\
an innocent touch where I am reminded of the patterns of life,\
the quiet ebb and flow of a breath,\
the barbed nurture to stay still \
that everyone learns and forever and beautifully fuck up\
and that warmth- too intoxicating to ask for

in a time where touch is nuanced, and it's innocence buried deep in romance\
where worms try to wriggle in;\
a gentle touch-\
a longing to forget the cold stillness of the world,\
reminded in the moment that the comfort that exists \
in my body like a transaction can be\
gentler,\
nurtured away from lust\
and softer on the heart

next time\
do not apologise for brushing my hand,\
or losing your balance on a winding bus-\
linger until you feel safe\
and you gain your footing,\
we cannot all run from our adorable clumsiness\
despite how we try\
to hide our embarrassed smile,\
when a stranger's face looks so unfamiliar without one.

# author's note
this piece i had written a while ago now and it was left in my notes app for quite some time. i do remember writing it though, and it definitely came at a low point where i realised i was drowning myself in intense emotions for the sake of it, and ended up basically digging myself into a depression forcefully from all the things i consumed and wrote. this was a way to dig out, to write something a lot softer and brighter and tone and reflect internal struggles with romantic/platonic affection i had during the time.

in honesty, this piece still feels very relevant to me and for notes app vomit, i think the ideas in it about losing human touch and a severely individualistic society have some legs that i'd love to explore with more intent in another piece!
