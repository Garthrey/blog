not a romantic yearning- no.\
an innocent touch where I am reminded of the patterns of life,\
the quiet ebb and flow of a breath,\
the barbed nurture to stay still \
that everyone learns and forever and beautifully fuck up\
and that warmth- too intoxicating to ask for

in a time where touch is nuanced, and it's innocence buried deep in romance\
where worms try to wriggle in;\
a gentle touch-\
a longing to forget the cold stillness of the world,\
reminded in the moment that the comfort that exists \
in my body like a transaction can be\
gentler,\
nurtured away from lust\
and softer on the heart

next time\
do not apologise for brushing my hand,\
or losing your balance on a winding bus-\
linger until you feel safe\
and you gain your footing,\
we cannot all run from our adorable clumsiness\
despite how we try\
to hide our embarrassed smile,\
when a stranger's face looks so unfamiliar without one.
