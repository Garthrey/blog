no guys seriously how do you write a blog HAHA

but while i figure that out, i guess this is a good opportunity to talk about setting up this blog!

### why blog? why now white girl?
![garfield sleeping](/_includes/img/blog1_garfield2.jpg)
i think in my 20s, having finally transitioned my gender and shifted into social groups that i truly feel at home with, i have only just realised how much my life was built on coping mechanisms i developed to make things make sense and for the world to be a lot more bearable.

not that my childhood was explicitly traumatic or anything, i think i just always had an easy way out through things such as digital escapism and sunk a lot of my life into games, anime, and other entertainment with a sole purpose of 'passing time' until 'it got better'. now i'm 25 as of writing this, and in coming face to face with how much i rely on doomscrolling and ambient consumption to exist day-to-day i have made it my goal— nay mission! to defeat the evil of not touching grass... in layman's terms, my new years resolution (following from late 2025) is to just be a lot more *intentional* with the things i do and create. to me, i've identified it to mean seeking boredom without the crutch of the phone algorithms and making conscious efforts how to spend my time, albeit playing through a game on my ds, sketching, or writing. the blog gives me the opportunity to just write some bullshit, but also gives me the opportunity to reflect on my time spent and really identify if i want to do more, or less of something. simple, right?

### the setup
![setting up the repo](/_includes/img/blog1_setup.jpg)
i think i have some sort of IT-related trauma from my degree, it's complicated, but i'm so thankful to have an incredibly lovely friend who not only helped me set this blasted thing up for **six hours**, but also was one of the biggest encouragements in even entertaining the idea of a neocities blog in the first place.

we used the [flamedfury guide for 11ty](https://flamedfury.com/guides/11ty-homepage-neocities/) since one of my biggest pain points in the previous blogs (and a huge reason for their decay) was how much of a pain in the ass writing out blogposts in straight up html was, and i was told this is a more front-loaded solution that will make updates in the future painless! so far in writing this post, yeah, well... heh... let's justr say... it's pretty awesome... like being able to functionally just type in discord-syntax (which also uses markdown) is just soo nice, plus image linking is 10x less horrendous than raw html!

there's not a lot to be said about the technical nitty-gritty from a programming ape like myself, it was very nice to hear from my friend that the experience of running me through it all was pretty painless though! speaking of the experience, i kind of just wanna touch on how awesome it is to have friends with these sorts of skills and just spending the day in their element, learning from them and just spending quality time trying to figure out why one of the navs won't take any padding values for 30 minutes. jokes aside, i've always had this childhood dream that likely stemmed from my watching of seinfeld where i wished for an apartment where i could have friends over and we'd just shoot shit and work on things together for fun and learning new things. i fear this blog is just gonna devolve into jerking off my friends and saying how much i love them.

so many thoughts!!


### draw steel!
![draw steel](/_includes/img/drawsteel.jpg)
i am a big sucker for ttrpgs. you will learn this sooo quickly. but imagine my shock as the forever gm that i get invited to a pathfinder 2e game of season of ghosts one week, and then my old group's gm asking for an eoi to try out the new MCDM system [draw steel](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/en-au/collections/draw-steel). to say i was doing backflips would be an understatement. 

draw steel is a self-described 'tactical heroic cinematic fantasy' game. basically what this boils down to is that it's a fantasy ttrpg that removes anything that does not support tactical, heroic, and/or cinematic gameplay. i was definitely intrigued in theory, but as with any concept it only goes as far as it's implemented— which thank god the designers have truly hit the nail on the head with it so far.

we're currently playing through the delian tomb starter adventure (very cutely designed after designer matt colville's youtube series on de-mystifying running ttrpgs: ['running the game'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_)) and so far the combat feels very reminiscent of [LANCER](https://massifpress.com/lancer) in the best way possible, while the 'narrative play' of the game has employed the sacred art of 'it doesn't fucking matter bro'. what does this look like? well, if you go back to 'heroic, cinematic fantasy' you can kind of figure it out. tracking gold? is it heroic or cinematic to mark down 2sp to buy a drink at the tavern? not really, so draw steel instead denotes your general wealth with a single value (e.g. 1 is enough to afford necessities, 2 is lavish living, 3 is enough to own a nice house, etc. etc. you get it.). this trickles down to things like reputation as well, and a completely forgone equipment tracking system in lieu of 'kits' which represent your equipment but also alter your gameplay via changing your character's speed, actions, etc. it really wears the mantra on its sleeve and forgoes a lot of ttrpg traditions in favour of selling this very punchy and snappy experience of just being badass heroes kicking doors in. at level 1, my troubador pregen walked into a room of a dozen goblins, power-slid into the room, played a power chord and slammed an entire squad of ~5 into a burning brazier and killed them instantly via environmental damage. and this was not even using my main action. this game is truly such a blast and classes all interlock with eachother to create awesome tactical scenarios, once again, in the tagline.

i can't wait for the next session, not only for my gm's awesome presence at the table and monster noises, but just to find out more about the system and this interesting take on stripping and rebuilding the unquestioned foundations of all these dnd-shackled fantasy ttrpgs.

### next steps
![two bikes](/_includes/img/bikes.jpg)
well, now that i have a working skeleton of the blog. all that's left blog-wise is to freshen up the css, get it looking like not a temu version of my friend's blog, and get to writing!

outside of the blog, i half-jokingly made a 'ins' vs 'outs' ny resolution list which honestly in doing so on the back of life events has actually proven very useful:

ins:
- showing my friends the love and physical affection i want to give
- writing with purpose and intent
- new art mediums
- being bored without my phone
- bike with friends

outs:
- being afraid of embarassment
- computer
- vitamin deficencies
- bad furniture
- bad injury management

mostly there's just a theme of not holding myself back, i think because i grew up around the 'nerdy kids' and on the internet, i typecasted myself into that stereotype and even when i fell in love with sports in highschool i just assumed that was a weird glitch more than anything. only in finding this new group of friends and continuing my volleyball pathway have i actually realised that i actually unfortunately *do* need to touch grass and i feel infinitely better cresting that initial embarassment of failure and the unfamiliar... how damning... but i have a feeling 2026 is going to be a year of a lot of movement, new experiences (but actually, not like in a trashy way), getting dripped the fuck out, and wrestling my friends. 

it is 2:44am as of finishing this non-stop stream of consciousness, i did suddenly have the thought of having a new blog-section for poems i write in a cute layout— but i fear that may step on the toes of the 'vitamin deficency' and 'bad injury management' parts of my resolution, so i will concede to bed and push up this post. good night.
