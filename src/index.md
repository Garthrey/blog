hello! i'm garthrey (they/she), a nerd from australia with a mind that races too quick and fingers too slow to keep up with them. i plan to use this site as primarily a blog and almost as the 'shadow' of my real-life social medias, in attempt to translate more internal and intimate thoughts/feelings against how awesome my life looks on a digicam. we will see how well this goes, but nonetheless i'm sure we'll all learn something along the way!

i am incredibly inexperienced when it comes to programming, so expect fixes/updates to be slow and if something doesn't work as intended— it's not intentional (probably)
