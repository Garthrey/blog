hello! i'm garthrey (they/she), a nerd with a mind that races too quick and fingers too slow to keep up with them. i'm focusing on wrapping up my education degree but i have my fingers in a lot of pies and starting my blog _for the third time_ to really dig into myself a bit more and use this space to hold me more accountable, plus serve as a bit of a journal.
