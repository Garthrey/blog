hello! i'm garthrey, a twenty-five year old non-binary person from australia. i was raised on the internet at a young age from my older brother and have always looked to the corners of the internet with a lot of awe and always wished to have a part in these non-traditional spaces such as private blogs, project sites, etc. 

i studied gamedev hardcore for a good while in my younger years and in realising how destitute i was as a programmer, i transitioned to my current career path of writing and education which kind of lands me in the position i am now... (with a lot of thoughts and writing, and not the technical skill to present it well in a blog). i have sincerely journaled very little in my life, and am actively feeling the strain of this muscle i have never used— so there'll be growing pains for me as i try to find my voice in this medium which is honestly very exciting for me!

### the blog

with help and especially inspiration from friends i started this blog (in all honesty) because i have a pretty poor memory for all the passing thoughts i have, and would like a sort of catalogue for the 'internal' whereas my other private social medias catalogue the 'external' through photos and posts. very funnily i actually started this blog twice prior, the first as a ramshackle diary for when i was rehabbing my reconstructed knee (again), and the second to serve as a creative journal for projects i was gonna force myself to get stuck into. both lasted exactly two entries. whoops.

i hope this website grows into a library of things important to me no matter how fleeting or trivial they may seem, and that hopefully you as the reader get to learn something about me, the world, or are otherwise inspired to do something awesome in this world :)

if you see a photo on here that has a little bit of spice, it's likely taken with this! fun fact, this is technically my first (and atm only) digicam! the flash is fucking crazy on this thing but it adds to the charm.
